######## FERRUS TALKING ABOUT LUNA 7.4 SERVER ######################
Played for a while and I can say you did great job with the map, but the server in overall is poorly designed.

The change of exp 8 -> 4. It's too steep, should be more natural like 8 -> 6 -> 4 at the very least, but best option would be custom formula so you don't have the feeling that you suddenly have to exp twice as long to get next level.
Lack of runes. No one is making them for sale (it just doesn't pay off), so your only option is to make another character. Now, why the hell would I want to sit on druid/sorc and make runes for hours? OTServ was supposed to be fun, and making runes is not fun! With such low population on this server, there must be runes in shop, and "there were no runes in shop in the old days" is not a valid argument. Back then, there were lots of people rune making, here you got none. Another point is, that it makes vocation unbalanced. Sorcerers don't need another character, uhs not really needed for them, and the rest runes they can make on their own. Druid is okay unless he want to hunt demons. Paladins are bad, but can exp with bolts and heal with mana. Knights are doomed.
HP/Mana regeneration. Way too fast, makes mages much better, paladins can hunt some weak stuff without bolt refilling or uh wasting, and knight again, doomed.
Player killing costs. Instead of banning them, I'd rather see the them loose more exp/ml/skills when they die, maybe lower their exp rate too.
Money is useless. This one is really annoying, you earn lots of money from hunting, but you have nothing to spend it on. No runes to buy, most eq you can get from quests, the rest you are going to loot eventually. That's why there should be runes in shops. Moreover items shouldn't be sellable in shop. Best items should be very hard to loot. Perhaps Dijnn quest would be better option.
Details. Things like same NPCs are really eye-catching.
Quests. Too many, or too easy. No puzzle quests. And the thing with keys made in the map rather in the scripts is annoying. At least reset server every day.
Hunting some monsters should be rarely profitable. Lots of exp, huge rune waste, but no big rewards (unless you are lucky). Right now, wherever you go, you barely waste any runes and always gets rewarded.
